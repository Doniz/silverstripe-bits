Silverstripe Bits
=================

A collection of [Silverstripe](http://www.silverstripe.org) code. This is all stuff which is generic enough to be versioned independently to a specific project, doesn't belong in a [boilerplate](https://github.com/lrc/silverstripe-boilerplate) and isn't involved enough to get its own module.
